  Hi I'm Annie and I'm a Sophomore majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy watching funny tik toks and going on Reddit to look at memes.
My favorite anime is Steins;Gate and I love shopping online for beauty products and clothing.
I love eating gourmet salad from Sweetgreen, a salad chain located in New York City.
