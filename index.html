      <p>Hi, my name is Annie Eng! I'm a Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical 
      and Computer Engineering. I currently have experience with Python. I am enthusiastic about 
      learning new things, right now I'm trying to learn a new piece on the piano called <a href= 
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y" target = "_blank">Liebstraum - Love dream</a> 
      by Franz Liszt.</p> 
      <p>I'm passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion for women in STEM. I was one of the 
      only females in my computer science and physics class in high school. But that changed with 
      one of my first experiences in STEM by being a research intern at New York University, which along
      the way solidified my interest in engineering. Here's my  <a href =
      "https://wp.nyu.edu/built/2018/08/21/2018-summer-research-presentations/" target = "_blank">research</a>
      I presented at the colloquium.
      </p> In my free time, I love to draw anime and go on Reddit to look at memes.
      Here is a progression of a drawing I created that I'm proud of:  </p>

      <h4>Application of Beauty</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p> One of the first independent projects I made with some guidance is 
      <a href="https://github.com/annieeng17/makeup" target="_blank"> 
      Application of Beauty</a>. Created using Python and Computer Vision, I wanted
      my term project in my 15-112 class to showcase something I like: makeup. I created 
      geometric shapes in openCV to display where to apply the beauty product, made
      dictionaries containing color pigments(gbr) to match different skin tones of users,
      and created a finite state machine to alternate between makeup features. I added
      some extra features for the user to modify such as a color opacity scale and created 
      an error prevention button to stop spamming the application. Here's a  <a href="
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJty-sH__E&t=1s" target="_blank"> link </a> 
      to show how to use the application from beginning to end. I included some
      photos to show my UI, layout of how I wanted my program to work, and a testrun 
      of one of the skin tone features.</p>

      <h4>Pin Baller</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p> A group project my friends and I made together in our Spring semester 
      of freshman year was called 'Pinballer' for a hardware hackathon called 
      Build18. Since we were freshmen, we didn't have a lot of experience with
      hardware equipment but we tried out best with the knowledge we learned 
      from our electrical engineering and programming classes. We had a week 
      to brainstorm and create our idea from the equipment we were provided with.
      We made a programming pinball game with added physics features. 
      For the hardware aspect, we connected an Arduino board with an accelerometer 
      to detect hand motion so the game can sense movement to score the ball.
      There was some malfunctions with the equipment since they were fragile, 
      but we adapted to what we had and finished on time.</p>
