      &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>Hi, my name is Annie Eng! I'm a Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical 
      and Computer Engineering. I have experience with Python and I'm currently learning C in class.
      I am enthusiastic about learning new things, right now I'm trying to learn a new piece on the 
      piano called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y" target = "_blank">Liebstraum - Love dream</a> 
      by Franz Liszt. The satisfaction of finishing a difficult task makes learning fun. There are 
      always ways to challenge yourself positively and that's through learning.</p> 

      <p>Relevant Coursework:  Principles of Imperative Computation (Fall 2020),
      Structure and Design of Digital Systems (Fall 2020), Matrices and Linear
      Transformations (Fall 2020), Fundamentals of Programming (Python), 
      Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering, Calculus
      in Three Dimensions, Concepts of Mathematics </p>

      <p>I'm passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion for women in STEM. I was one of the 
      only females in my computer science and physics class in high school. That changed with 
      one of my first experiences in STEM by being a research intern at New York University, which 
      solidified my interest in engineering. I loved working with other women in
      STEM and contributing to an important project to help people. Here's my <a href =
      "https://wp.nyu.edu/built/2018/08/21/2018-summer-research-presentations/" target = "_blank">research</a>
      I presented at the colloquium.
      </p> 
      <p>In my free time, I love to draw anime and go on Reddit to look at memes.
      I was recently awarded with a scholarship through Girls Who Code to learn from General Assembly's User Experience
      course to apply what I will learn to create user oriented projects. I'm super excited to start the course and
      showcase my creative curiousity through the projects I create in the future! </p>
      <p>Also ~ here is a progression of a drawing I created that I'm proud of:  </p>

      <h4>Application of Beauty</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p> One of the first independent projects I made with some guidance is 
      <a href="https://github.com/annieeng17/makeup" target="_blank"> 
      Application of Beauty</a>. Created using Python and Computer Vision, I wanted
      my term project in my 15-112 class to showcase something I like: makeup. I created 
      geometric shapes in openCV to display where to apply the beauty product, made
      dictionaries containing color pigments(gbr) to match different skin tones of users,
      and created a finite state machine to alternate between makeup features. I added
      some extra features for the user to modify such as a color opacity scale and created 
      an error prevention button to stop spamming the application. </p>
      <p>I also learned how to incorporate feedback from my peers and mentors
      to enhance the functionality of the game. Here's a  <a href="
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEJty-sH__E&t=1s" target="_blank"> link </a> 
      to show how to use the application from beginning to end. I included some
      photos to show my UI, layout of how I wanted my program to work, and a test
      run of one of the skin tone features.</p>

      <h4>Pin Baller</h4>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p> A group project my friends and I made together in our Spring semester 
      of freshman year was called 'Pinballer' for a hardware hackathon called 
      Build18. Since we were freshmen, we tried our best with the limited knowledge we learned 
      from our electrical engineering and programming classes. We had a week 
      to brainstorm and create our idea from the equipment we were provided with.
      During our brainstorming sessions, we collaborated to see how our unique 
      skills could be used to create a project.</p>
      <p>We made a programming pinball game with added physics features. 
      For the hardware aspect, we connected an Arduino board with an accelerometer 
      to detect hand motion so the game can sense movement to move the bumpers on
      screen. There were some malfunctions with the equipment since they were fragile, 
      but we adapted to what we had and finished on time.</p>
