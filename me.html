    <p>Hi, my name is Annie Eng! I'm a Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical 
    and Computer Engineering. I have experience with Python and C.
    I am enthusiastic about learning new things, right now I'm trying to learn a new piece on the 
    piano called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y" target = "_blank">Liebstraum - Love dream</a> 
    by Franz Liszt. The satisfaction of finishing a difficult task makes learning fun. There are 
    always ways to challenge yourself positively and that's through learning.</p>
